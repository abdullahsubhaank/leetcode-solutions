## Overview & Methodology
This repository serves as a version-controlled practice log for algorithmic problem-solving. All solutions are written in **Python 3** and are thoroughly tested locally using custom test suites before being submitted to the LeetCode platform. 

The primary goal is to build a structured approach to problem-solving, focusing on:
1. Understanding core data structures.
2. Optimizing time and space complexity.
3. Writing clean, edge-case resilient code.
4. Documenting approaches for future reference.

## Topic Directories

### 1. [Arrays & Strings](./arrays-strings)
Focuses on array manipulation, hash maps, and the two-pointer technique.
- Contains solutions for problem solving without allocating extra space (in-place modifications).

### 2. [Basic Algorithms](./basic-algorithms)
Focuses on fundamental algorithmic patterns.
- Contains implementations of Binary Search ($O(\log n)$) and array partitioning.

### 3. [Stacks](./stacks)
Focuses on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures.
- Contains state-tracking solutions like bracket validation.

### 4. [Linked Lists](./linked-lists)
Focuses on pointer manipulation across node-based structures.
- Contains iterative reversal patterns.

## Local Testing & Verification
Every python file in this repository includes a standalone `__main__` test block. This ensures that code logic, type hinting, and boundary limits are verified locally before touching the LeetCode judge. 

Testing covers:
* **Typical Use Cases:** Standard inputs.
* **Edge Cases:** Empty arrays, single elements, negative constraints, and duplicate values.

Accepted screenshots confirming a successful LeetCode submission are stored alongside the solutions in their respective folders as `NN-result.png`.

## How to Run Tests
To run the local test suite for any problem, execute the python file from the root directory:

```bash
# Example: Running tests for Two Sum
python arrays-strings/01-two-sum.py
